# COBALTBREW

## Description:

This is a simple python script that allows the user to get multiple hashes for a local file on their system, or a remote file on the internet. Then the added option to check if that hash exists on Virustotal. The main objective here, was a quick simple way of getting multiple hashes, and confirming if someone has uploaded the file to Virustotal for anti-virus checks.<br />
